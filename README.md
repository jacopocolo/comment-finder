# comment-detector (name tbd)
## A Chrome plugin to find comments hidden on the internet

TODO:
- [ ] Create a share button for each comment in the plugin
- [ ] Fix timestamp differences between JS and php
- [ ] Fix loading issues, sometimes the comments are _still_ not sent
- [ ] Fix preview image so it's big enough for opengraph metadata
